# TapoPlugPowerUsage-Influx
A Simple Python script to upload power usage to an Influx DB

## Disclaimer
This program was heavily based on [0xSamy's TapoPlug-Rest-API repo](https://gitlab.com/0xSamy/TapoPlug-Rest-API), but, both to better understand how it works and to customize it to my needs, I decided to implement my own version in the script.

## Configuration
Set all the parameters in the `config.py` file.
